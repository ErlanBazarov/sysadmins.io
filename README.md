#SYSADMINS.IO 

##system administration as a service and on-demand -- completely free

Target Market:   
System administrators, non-technical founders, busy IT admins.

Value Prop:  
On-demand, faster, quicker, and higher-quality system administration from trusted individuals who can be contacted 24/7

UX:  
Log in, create a ticket, get assigned to a qualified S.A. automatically.
Public API to create slack-like chat room comments, where each server is almost like a room in of itself.




Protoype 1 Goals:  
* Get sysadmins in contact with customers. 
* Find out who are customers are.
* Make sure SA transparency is evident.  (Deferred)
* High quality SA's screened by internal experts. (Deferred)

Ideas & Drafts for next MVP's:
* Lightweight daemon that can run on servers that give permission to enable higher transparency and monitoring of the SA.
* Automation for the servers created.
*  Look at ServerPilot
*  Interactive console in the browser
*  PAAS - deploy docker instances for some sort of certification process.
*  Start Automating basic Sysadmin tasks through proprietary software.
*  

Revenue Sources:  
* Delayed
* % of relationship
* Open.EDU model & donations
* Charge per server to use the full platform.

Other Points:
* Is typeform insecure for this purpose?
* 

#MVP1 DOC (EXPERIMENT OUTLINE)

Target Market: Non-technical founders and executives, busy sysadmins, IT Staff

Ideal Customer: Business Executives (Joe) who are for some reason unable to manage servers themselves reasons include
        - Non-technical ability
        - Lack of time
        - Expects higher quality from sa.io

Problem: Joe has a business with servers to run, but he has no idea how to manage them. He doesnt have the capabilities or budget to hire a full time
system administrator, but is willing to hire a contractor. However, he has had poor experiences with contractors and hopes that he can just find someone trustworthy to manage his servers. The reason he had poor experiences was partially because of a lack of transparency between he and the system administrator.

Assumptions:

Joe has servers
Joe cares about what his system administrators are doing
Joe knows what servers and system administrators are
Joe has had poor experiences with contractors and managed VPS.

Solution: Joe finds sysadmins.io where he can dive right into getting his problems

Competitors: Managed VPS.
