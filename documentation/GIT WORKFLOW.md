#GIT WORKFLOW

For now, all commits should be made under a personal (rivanov-branch) or feature-branch (chat-branch) or forked off the repo.   

Commits should go through a **pull-request** because it encourages collaboration and code-review and reduces danger of pushing directly to master.

For now, let's just use whatever pull-request mechanism feels the most comfortable to you and we'll come together to a final decision together on a single consolidated workflow in the future.  

For now, however. Let's make sure all commits are going through pull-requests.
