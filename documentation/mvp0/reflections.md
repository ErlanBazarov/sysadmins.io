##MAKING MEETINGS MORE PRODUCTIVE
* efficient meetings
* have an agenda going in
* don't talk to Rivanov about business-oriented things
* be concrete about what features we want and need
* be forward thinking about the architecture of the platform ahead of time
* be three to four MVPs ahead - steve

##OTHER NOTES
