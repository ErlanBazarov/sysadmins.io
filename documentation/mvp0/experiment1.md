Target Market: Non-technical founders and executives, busy sysadmins, IT Staff

Ideal Customer: Business Executives (Joe) who are for some reason unable to manage servers themselves reasons include
        - Non-technical ability
        - Lack of time
        - Expects higher quality from sa.io

Problem: Joe has a business with servers to run, but he has no idea how to manage them. He doesnt have the capabilities or budget to hire a full time
system administrator, but is willing to hire a contractor. However, he has had poor experiences with contractors and hopes that he can just find someone trustworthy to manage his servers. The reason he had poor experiences was partially because of a lack of transparency between he and the system administrator.

Assumptions:

Joe has servers
Joe cares about what his system administrators are doing
Joe knows what servers and system administrators are
Joe has had poor experiences with contractors and managed VPS.

Solution: Joe finds sysadmins.io where he can dive right into getting his problems

Competitors: Managed VPS.

Questions:
What kinds of problems does a developer have? What kinds of tickets will they need?  -- How do I set up a website? How do I deploy django on Hostgator? Set up IPtables on my server
How does Joe (our customer) communicate or desire to communicate? 
Would they prefer to pay per-ticket? or per-server on a monthly basis?

					 
Experiment:
Driver 5 customers to the platform that fit different categories. Find who you can get, see the types of tickets they input
* Novice developer I
* Intermediate sysadmin
* Non-technical person who wants a website
* Technical startup guy without a lot of time

Get into contact with more sysadmins, more startup founders, more mom and pop shops

Conclusions:
* Are they filling up tickets the way they want? Is the ticket form friendly? -- No, not for web designers and people without a site already.
* How are our assumptions? Does Joe KNOW what a sysadmin is? -- Yes, our customer segment assumes users are slightly technical
* Is there a strong value prop for web designers, 18 yr old luke, intermediate sysadmins? 
				* Web designers -- not yet, need a weay to set up a site completely
				* 18 yr old - ditto
				* intermediate sysadmins -
* Does transparency resonate with our clients?

Customer search:
* small design agencies
* r/sysadmin
* r/entrepreneur, r/startup, r/design
* 12 year old luke
* designers older adults without IT/sysadmin experience
Results:
Adam Freymiller - Hostgator, how do i deploy a django app? Hostgator support is insufficient. Form and website didnt seem to match his needs


tech-oriented, tech-interested:
2/3 - managed vps
1/3 - shared hosting

rondorulesyeah living on your own sucks if you don't have a lot of friends
saifalharthiYeah. I am still new in the US. So I have to make friends  :D

rondorulesmanaged it myself
jxriddlehad apache running on an old computer at the house. later, just got a server and convinced the (small town) ISP to host it.
lukeberry99my first site? that was before cheap cloud hosting

lukeberry99i think i was shared hosting on site5 or something
jxriddleyeah, totally weird. x.x
jxriddlewish it wasn't so IT-geared. I'd rather be coding more. hosting it yourself means you gotta deal with more IT junk.  :(
rondoruleslearned a bit of linux admin on the interwebs
jxriddlemuch rather focus on dev.
lukeberry99like initially was apache on a local machine but my first proper website was on shared hosting, learnt linux, cheap cloud hosting came around, been VPS and dedis ever since
mariaNYC joined the room.
lukeberry99initially i wanted to make a website to do with a game i was playing (no idea what) but then i just got super interested in how everything worked
jxriddleyeah, interest in tech, but more in dev... but, at the time, didn't know dev very well. tech/IT just turned into more of a hassle as got into dev.
lukeberry99yeah the first site, i was like 12-13
rondorulestechy/geek. prolly why I'm on this site as well lol
lukeberry99not really, not at the time. was just a kid playing games, entirely different now ofc
saifalharthithe 12 year old Luke is your ideal case.
rondorulesI know in the IM space a lot of people don't know how to setup hosting and websites
rondoruleshuge potential there
stephenhuhIM?
rondorulesInternet Marketing

ondorulesyour customer has to have the need for your service. Also has to be willing to pay for your service and finally must have the ability to pay for your service
saifalharthiand More into dev not to sysadmin

s. I personally think your target market are things like small web design/development shops, internet marketing, etc

help me set up my site
