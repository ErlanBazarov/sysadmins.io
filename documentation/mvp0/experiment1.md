Target Market: Non-technical founders and executives, busy sysadmins, IT Staff

Ideal Customer: Business Executives (Joe) who are for some reason unable to manage servers themselves reasons include
        - Non-technical ability
        - Lack of time
        - Expects higher quality from sa.io

Problem: Joe has a business with servers to run, but he has no idea how to manage them. He doesnt have the capabilities or budget to hire a full time
system administrator, but is willing to hire a contractor. However, he has had poor experiences with contractors and hopes that he can just find someone trustworthy to manage his servers. The reason he had poor experiences was partially because of a lack of transparency between he and the system administrator.

Assumptions:

Joe has servers
Joe cares about what his system administrators are doing
Joe knows what servers and system administrators are
Joe has had poor experiences with contractors and managed VPS.

Solution: Joe finds sysadmins.io where he can dive right into getting his problems

Competitors: Managed VPS.
