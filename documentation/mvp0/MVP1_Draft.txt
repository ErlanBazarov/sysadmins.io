#Sysadmins.io

##Experiment 1:
Customer:
* People that need sysadmin help. Fast, on-demand, and simple. 
* *Non-technical founders.  (JOE)*
* People on the web (setting up personal websites)
* Sysadmins with too many servers to watch.

###Who is Joe?
Needs some kind of service done on their server i.e. set up NGINX or Apache. Not familiar with system administration. Who wants to set up a business. Non-technical.

###Problem that Joe faces?
"Dude... I just want my idea up and running"
**Joe has no method of getting high-quality system administration on-demand**

###Assumptions: (revise)
**1. Joe knows what system administration is.**
2. Joe has a server.
3. Joe knows how to use a website.

##MVP 1 (basic plan):
Login.
Open a server ticket.
pIt'll send an email to internal team.


##Roadmap
Panel that shows current tasks that sysadmin is doing.
Chat matches you with a sysadmin.
